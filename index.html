        <p>Dear John, <br>I have had a lot of fun making this birthday present. As I was doing so, a lot of good memories sprung up and I started to remember some of the funny conversations that we had a long time ago. :D The card that I have shown below represents all of the things that I see you as or remind me of you. I think words can lose their meaning sometimes, especially if it's over an online chat and we're not face to face, so I wanted to show you them through this means. I hope you like this present and that we can continue to have fun chats.</p>
