        <p>Dear John, <br><br>
            I’m really happy to have met you and had such fun conversations. I really couldn’t have known that I was meeting someone who has a lot in common with me, when I first messaged you on Discord, and I was so excited that we talked practically every day. You told me loads of stories about yourself, so at some point I started to think you were recounting your past 18 lives with the amount of information that you revealed. To this day, I am not sure whether you were a girl in your past life with twintails by the name of Uzume Tennouboshi. Recently, you asked me about my skincare routine, so I grew even more certain of this, jkkkk XD!!!!! <br> <br>I also learned to open up to someone for the first time. Thank you for making me feel so comfortable and thank you for being my precious friend. I have really enjoyed making this present, and the drawing of the wolf represents the things/ characteristics that remind me of you. Let’s have more fun chats together, this year!</p>
